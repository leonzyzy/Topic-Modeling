I’d like to recognize Yifei Wang for being an outstanding teammate and an invaluable partner throughout my onboarding and recent projects. Yifei has played a key role in helping me explore and implement the LitData pipeline, troubleshoot PyTorchJob, and set up a systematized workflow that has made it significantly easier for us to run and manage experiments efficiently.

His deep technical expertise and willingness to dive into problems with me—whether it's setting up infrastructure, debugging issues, or improving our experimental flow—have made a big impact. I truly appreciate his support, collaboration, and the time he’s invested to help me ramp up quickly.

I'm very grateful to have Yifei as a teammate and look forward to working with him more in the future!
