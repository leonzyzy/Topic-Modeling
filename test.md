I’d like to highlight Yifei’s strong skills in software engineering and machine learning infrastructure. For our Sequence Assist projects, Yifei built the entire ETL and Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP), which significantly accelerated our data processing workflow—including standardization and feature selection.

Yifei also developed pipelines to support litdata and PyTorchJob, enabling seamless integration with KFP. This was a major achievement that made our model training pipeline highly efficient and scalable, allowing us to train transformer models on large-scale datasets and ensuring smooth experimentation.

In addition, Yifei has made substantial contributions to C1-Bumblebee, our model library for the Genesis team. He puts great emphasis on system design, Docker image maintenance, GitHub PRs, unit testing, and documentation—helping to ensure high-quality and sustainable code.

Yifei also introduced Weights & Biases to the Sequence Assist team, making it easy to track experiment results and greatly enhancing reproducibility.

As a data scientist, I truly appreciate Yifei’s technical expertise and collaboration. I would be thrilled to work with him again in the future as our MLE. He brings deep technical skills and consistently delivers impact.
