I’d like to give a big shoutout to my teammate, Anhui Wang, for being an incredible partner during my onboarding and beyond. Anhui has been instrumental in helping me get up to speed with several technical setups, including Homebrew, Spark ETL, Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP), and more. He patiently walked me through running a Spark ETL pipeline using the KFP launcher, which was extremely helpful for the Sequence Assist project.

Beyond that, Anhui has consistently gone above and beyond in answering every technical question I’ve had—whether it’s debugging PyTorchJob, setting up AWS credentials, configuring PVC and data storage, or using Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.

I feel incredibly fortunate to have Anhui as a teammate. His support, knowledge, and willingness to help make a huge difference, and I truly look forward to continuing to work with him in the future.
