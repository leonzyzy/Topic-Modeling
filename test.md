Absolutely — based on your contributions to the **Risk Assist** project, here are some additional **Competency Strengths Demonstrated** that you can include, beyond what's already mentioned in the write-up:

### **Additional Competency Strengths Demonstrated – Risk Assist**

* **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Worked effectively across teams including MLEs, fraud data scientists, and LLM platform owners (CAT3-B\&T, IAAS). This shows strong collaboration in a technically complex, cross-functional environment, especially when resolving endpoint inconsistencies pre-deployment.

* **Model Deployment Readiness**: Played a critical role in ensuring model performance consistency and production readiness. Your quick debugging of LLM endpoint issues and facilitation of deployment highlights strong ownership and attention to detail under tight timelines.

* **Customer-Centric Mindset**: Maintained a clear focus on how technical decisions (e.g., model accuracy, endpoint issues, reflexion framework insights) translate into real-world impact — such as reducing fraud risk and increasing stakeholder trust in model outputs.

* **Explainability & Insight Generation**: Led the integration of Reflexion and developed explainable insights that were scored highly by human experts (80% satisfaction from risk managers), which reflects your ability to bridge the gap between model output and business understanding.

* **Iterative Feedback Loop with Stakeholders**: Presented weekly updates and proactively integrated stakeholder feedback into experimental design and evaluation, demonstrating strong communication and iterative development practices.

* **Strategic Thinking & Product Fit**: Ensured that the LLM model produced not just technically sound output, but **business-aligned insights** that matched risk managers' needs — a critical skill when aligning machine learning with enterprise outcomes.

Let me know if you'd like me to directly revise your Risk Assist write-up to incorporate these strengths or if you're preparing them for a specific format (e.g., performance review, self-assessment, resume bullets).
