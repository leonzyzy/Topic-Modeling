Absolutely! Below is your self-evaluation write-up for the **FPF-Occultation** project, following the same structured format as the Risk Assist summary, with three clear sections: **Key Results**, **Competency Strengths**, and **Competency Opportunities**. This version emphasizes the **business impact**, **technical leadership**, and **cross-team value** you brought to the project.

## ðŸ”¹ **Key Results**

The **FPF-Occultation** project focused on developing a **challenger transformer architecture** for detecting unauthorized payments using sequential signals at the **account ID level**, with the ultimate goal of **minimizing fraud, protecting customer safety, and reducing financial loss** for the company. My contributions were pivotal in transforming the projectâ€™s feasibility and outcomes:

* Identified and resolved critical data standardization bugs in existing code within my first week of onboarding, highlighting immediate value. I raised the issue, opened a pull request, and corrected the logic, directly improving model training integrity and preventing future errors.

* **Spearheaded the implementation of Genesisâ€™s first streaming training pipeline** using **LitData and PyTorchJob**, enabling large-scale transformer training on massive payment datasets. This addressed a critical gap in our infrastructure that previously limited training to small, local datasets.

* **Achieved a 100x acceleration in training speed** through pipeline optimization, eliminating long wait times and significantly increasing model experimentation throughput.

* **Delivered full-scale benchmark results** using the complete training dataset, which laid the groundwork for real-world deployment and measurable fraud reduction. The top benchmark score of **0.130** outperformed the existing GBM production model and marked a step-change in fraud detection capability.

* **Innovated novel model architectures** including **sequence-to-sequence** and **skip-connection-based transformers**, which pushed performance further, achieving a new best benchmark of **0.133**.

* **Contributed reusable model code, unit tests, and libraries** to **C1-Bumblebee**, elevating team standards, improving reproducibility, and encouraging cross-project adoption.

* **Scaled the training pipeline across multiple projects within the team**, enabling others to finally train on real, large datasets. This contributed to **broader knowledge of LitData** across fraud and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) teams.

* **Presented the project and its outcomes** to the AML team, facilitating horizontal impact and promoting best practices across business domains.

* **Regularly communicated progress and technical insights** through weekly updates and slide decks, enabling rapid feedback, stakeholder alignment, and efficient iteration with MLEs and business teams.

## ðŸ”¹ **Competency Strengths**

Throughout the FPF-Occultation project, I demonstrated strong competencies in both technical innovation and team collaboration:

* **End-to-End Ownership and Execution**: Initiated and delivered a **critical ML infrastructure project within my first month**, despite the absence of existing frameworks or documentation. This effort created foundational capabilities for large-scale model training at Genesis.

* **Advanced ML System Design**: Engineered a robust streaming pipeline that considered **future scalability, data types, GPU utilization, memory optimization, and storage constraints**, ensuring flexibility for downstream projects.

* **Technical Mentorship**: Onboarded and mentored colleagues (Plaksha and Karthik) on LitData and PyTorchJob, empowering them to run multiple transformer experiments, including sequence length ablations and architecture tuning.

* **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Supported **colleagues from the broader fraud DS team** with pipeline troubleshooting and best practices, making the solution a reference across multiple verticals.

* **Strategic Communication**: Built and delivered compelling **business-aligned presentations** that translated complex modeling results into actionable insights for stakeholders in the fraud space.

* **Innovation and Experimentation**: Consistently pushed technical boundaries by proposing and testing new model architectures and optimizations, showing initiative in driving the project's evolution.

## ðŸ”¹ **Competency Opportunities**

This project provided several growth areas where I was able to expand my impact and capabilities:

* **Technical Leadership at Scale**: While I had experience with model training, this project gave me the opportunity to drive **foundational ML infrastructure**, impacting not just one model but **entire workflows across teams**.

* **Internal Navigation & Access Enablement**: Building this pipeline from scratch required **navigating Capital Oneâ€™s complex internal systems**, obtaining access permissions, and identifying the right internal toolsâ€”all of which expanded my organizational knowledge and resourcefulness.

* **Business Alignment in Early Research**: By working closely with stakeholders and regularly presenting progress, I gained deeper insight into **how infrastructure and model performance translate to business value**, particularly in fraud prevention.

* **Cross-Domain Enablement**: Presenting the pipeline to AML and expanding its use across other teams helped strengthen my understanding of **how reusable tools and infrastructure** can maximize ROI and create long-term value.
