ðŸ”¹ Key Results
Over the course of the Risk Assist project, I contributed to delivering impactful machine learning solutions that improved risk detection, supported risk mitigation strategies, and streamlined knowledge-sharing. The project centered around mapping unstructured text descriptions of risk events to a structured taxonomy and generating natural language insights from aggregated data tables. Below are the core outcomes:

Developed and deployed a few-shot learning approach to predict containment types and risk events, achieving 96% accuracy, which matched stakeholder expectations and is now in model production. This significantly enhances our ability to proactively identify risk containment strategies and supports real-time operational decisions.

Introduced and implemented a novel chain-of-thought framework for predicting root cause Level 1 & 2 and containment types. This approach improved prediction accuracy by over 10%, received positive feedback from senior leaders (MVPs, VPs), and established a reusable pattern for future models.

Built a hierarchical taxonomy-based model for root cause Level 1 & 2 classification, which boosted performance from 78%/73% to 89% (Level 1) and 81% (Level 2). The method was presented at the Modeling Analytics Conference (MAC) and received significant attention from senior executives.

Led insight generation experiments by crafting and testing prompt variants, incorporating stakeholder feedback, and eventually implementing the Reflexion framework. This process improved insight quality and reduced hallucinations in LLM outputs, helping risk managers take informed action faster.

Engaged weekly with risk managers to refine risk event labeling and improve the classification model, leading to higher model accuracy and better alignment with real-world scenarios.

Consistently delivered updates and presented findings at Risk Assist tech and stakeholder meetings, contributing to timely project milestones and maintaining alignment across technical and business teams.

Participated in white paper writing and review, ensuring regulatory alignment and clear communication of the methodology to model risk officers.

Contributed to production readiness, collaborating with MLEs to support model deployment and UI designâ€”gaining hands-on exposure to operational workflows and infrastructure.

Ideated future roadmap items to extend Risk Assistâ€™s applicability across different risk domains and business strategies, supporting the projectâ€™s long-term scalability.

ðŸ”¹ Competency Strengths
Throughout this project, I demonstrated several core strengths, especially in technical and collaborative competencies:

Technical Excellence: Designed and implemented advanced ML approaches (few-shot learning, hierarchical modeling, chain-of-thought reasoning, prompt engineering, and Reflexion framework). These approaches led to substantial performance gains and were aligned with production-level standards.

Innovation and Thought Leadership: Pioneered techniques like chain-of-thought in the risk domainâ€”used for the first time in this organizationâ€”and laid the foundation for scalable, explainable models.

Collaboration and Communication: Maintained a strong cadence of communication with business stakeholders and risk managers, incorporating their feedback into model development and insight evaluation. Regularly presented results in a clear, business-aligned manner.

Execution and Delivery: Met all project deadlines, ensured production readiness, and delivered consistent updates with transparent reportingâ€”earning trust from cross-functional teams and leadership.

Strategic Thinking: Contributed to model documentation, future roadmap ideation, and stakeholder discussions, showing a forward-looking mindset that aligns model development with broader business goals.

ðŸ”¹ Competency Opportunities
As a new hire, this project offered valuable opportunities to strengthen my business acumen and stakeholder alignment:

Business Context Understanding: While my technical skills were well-established, working closely with risk managers allowed me to deepen my understanding of risk taxonomies, containment strategies, and real-world operational constraints. This improved my ability to design models with practical business utility.

Stakeholder Engagement: By participating in weekly discussions and feedback loops, I improved my ability to frame model results and design decisions in ways that resonate with non-technical stakeholders. This has made me a more effective collaborator across functions.

End-to-End ML Lifecycle Experience: Supporting MLEs in model deployment and UI design helped me gain exposure to production pipelines, system integration, and user experience considerationsâ€”critical skills for scaling AI solutions beyond prototype.

Model Governance Awareness: Assisting with model documentation and responding to feedback from the model risk officer introduced me to regulatory expectations and governance frameworks that are crucial in financial services.
