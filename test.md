Working with Ryan on the Risk-Assist LLM project has been an incredibly positive and rewarding experience. As a Data Scientist, I truly value strong collaboration between business and technical teams, and Ryan has exemplified what it means to be an outstanding business stakeholder and partner.

Throughout the project, Ryan has consistently demonstrated strong leadership and ownership. He has successfully led our weekly meetings, always coming prepared with clear agendas, well-defined business goals, and a sharp focus on outcomes. His ability to communicate complex business needs in a way that aligns with our technical objectives has helped the team stay aligned and focused. Ryan's attention to detail and forward planning has made our workflows smoother and more efficient.

What I appreciate most is Ryan’s active engagement in the technical side of the work. For example, when we had questions regarding the LLM classification results for risk events, Ryan provided invaluable support as a domain expert. He took the time to help us interpret and analyze the model outputs, offering thoughtful feedback and helping us improve the quality of our results. His insights added depth and business relevance to the technical analysis, ultimately making the work more impactful.

Additionally, during the insight generation phase, Ryan played a critical role in evaluating the quality of the outputs. When we needed domain experts to assign scores to the generated insights, Ryan was incredibly responsive and efficient. He turned around the scoring process very quickly, which was instrumental in helping us meet a tight deadline for a white paper submission. His commitment and responsiveness under pressure were truly appreciated.

Beyond his technical contributions, Ryan is simply a great person to work with. He is always approachable, enthusiastic, and supportive. He fosters a positive team dynamic, encourages open communication, and makes every interaction constructive and forward-moving. It’s rare to find someone who can so effectively bridge the gap between business strategy and data science execution, and Ryan does this exceptionally well.

Overall, I consider Ryan to be an excellent business partner and collaborator. His leadership, communication, and willingness to dive into the details have significantly contributed to the success of our project. I’ve learned a lot through our collaboration and would be absolutely thrilled to work with him again on future initiatives.
