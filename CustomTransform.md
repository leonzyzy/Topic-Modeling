â€”- Chain of Thought:

The scenario describes a transition of work responsibilities from one team to another, with the FDSO team continuing to manage cases until a full system transition to Empath is complete.
To ensure case management remains effective, a Business Control Report was implemented to track case inventory and ensure prioritization based on specific criteria (e.g., priority and pended time frames).
The implementation of the Business Control Report and tracking of case inventory constitutes monitoring and control measures to manage the transition effectively.
Since the containment plan is explicitly defined as "Implemented Monitoring / Control," this aligns with the measures described in the scenario.
