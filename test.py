@@Chain of Thought:  
1. Lost, stolen, and failed transactions were accounted for in reporting fraud claims.  
2. When transactions were captured in the failure report, agents were unable to determine how to care for customer needs.  
3. Agents did not have the necessary information to assess the required next steps for transactions populating on the report.  
4. The procedures for managing the monitoring reports were incomplete, as the team did not have detailed instructions to handle this process before it was added to their work.  

@@Chain of Thought:  
1. Agents erroneously manually debited accounts for the amounts of prior past-due fee waivers.  
2. While attempting to apply a credit to the most recent past-due fee, agents mistakenly applied a debit instead, resulting in an error.  
3. In WCSA, the agent selected the previous fee credit instead of the actual fee charged during that cycle.  
4. Agents did not follow the outlined steps in the "waivers" task, specifically for past-due fee, cash advance fee, and interest.
