The delivery of the statement is outsourced to USPS, a third-party logistics provider.
The failure to receive the statement on time was due to an external factor (USPS truck fire/accident), not the company itself.
The company relies on USPS to fulfill its obligation to deliver statements, making USPS a fulfillment partner in this process.
Since the failure was caused by the third party (USPS), it falls under Partner Fulfillment rather than an internal operational issue.
