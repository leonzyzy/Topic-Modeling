Scaling Policy – The addition of a scaling policy that terminates the process when CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold indicates a capacity limitation.
Process Interruption – The bundle process was unable to complete due to the scaling policy, which suggests a performance issue tied to resource management (in this case, CPU usage).
System Inability to Handle Certain Tasks – The inability to bundle letters without attachments is a direct result of system performance restrictions, pointing to a deficiency in how the system handles resource demands.
