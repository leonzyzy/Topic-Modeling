refers to a disconnect between the original business objectives or goals and the execution or implementation of those objectives. It occurs when the planned approach or strategy does not align with the way it is carried out, leading to undesired outcomes or inefficiencies. This gap typically arises due to miscommunication, lack of clarity, or incorrect assumptions about how a process should function or be executed.
