Improper Case Prioritization – Empath failed to prioritize cases correctly after they were reclassified. This indicates that the system's logic or the code responsible for managing case priorities was not functioning as intended.

Gaps in Logic – There were gaps in the Empath logic that caused cases not to be reclassified successfully. These gaps suggest a flaw in the design or coding of the system, where the necessary functionality was either not fully implemented or was improperly coded.

Failure to Trigger Action – The system did not trigger the necessary actions (e.g., notifying the Back Office team or prioritizing cases) after cases were reclassified, highlighting a failure in how the application or system was designed to handle case workflows.

Missed Cases – Cases were not worked within the desired timeframe because they were not properly flagged or identified by the system. This further points to an issue in how the system was designed to track and manage cases.
