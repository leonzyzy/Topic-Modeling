Lack of Monitoring for Fraud Application Status Changes – There was no system in place to track when fraud-flagged accounts should have their restrictions lifted, leading to prolonged restrictions.
Missed Historical Defects – The control implemented in June 2022 was designed to detect and resolve these issues but did not perform a lookback to identify past cases, indicating insufficient historical monitoring.
Failure in Reporting Design – The report was intended to detect and correct affected accounts but was not built to retroactively address cases that occurred before its implementation, showing a gap in business oversight.
Dependence on Manual Discovery – The secured card team had to identify the issue themselves, rather than it being proactively flagged by automated monitoring or reports.
