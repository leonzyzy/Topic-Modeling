Insights
'Inadequate / inaccurate procedures'

There is a peak of incidents in Q3 2022 with 14 events, showing a period of high issues related to inadequate procedures.

The numbers remained relatively stable from Q1 2022 onward, suggesting a recurring problem that wasn't fully resolved.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - System'

The peak event count of 15 occurred in Q2 2022, possibly linked to system upgrades or transitions.

From Q1 2023 onward, there was a gradual decline, indicating that improvements in change management practices were implemented.

'Capacity or Performance Deficiency'

The sharp rise from Q1 2021 to Q4 2022, peaking at 14 events, indicates growing concerns about system capacity.

By Q4 2023, a decrease to 7 suggests that corrective actions may have alleviated some of the capacity issues.

Comments
The data provides clear evidence that issues with change management, both at the system and process levels, were particularly prominent in 2022.

The 'Capacity or Performance Deficiency' peaked around Q4 2022, indicating that system performance may have been under strain during this period.

Business monitoring and partner fulfillment issues were notably higher in 2022, suggesting operational challenges or changes that led to more risk events.

Events related to design, coding, and third-party systems highlight potential technical shortcomings that affected overall performance, especially in 2022.

The stable or declining events in 2023 could point to the effectiveness of corrective measures and adjustments implemented earlier.

Comments
'Inadequate / inaccurate procedures'
The data suggests that inadequate procedures were a recurring issue over the periods, especially peaking in Q3 2022. This indicates possible inefficiencies in procedures that needed ongoing attention.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - System'
The increased number of events in Q2 2022 highlights issues with system changes or upgrades. The peak at 15 events suggests that the company may have faced difficulties in managing changes to their systems during this time.

'Capacity or Performance Deficiency'
There was a noticeable increase in capacity or performance deficiencies, especially in late 2022, peaking at 14 events. This suggests that systems were likely under stress or facing performance issues, which may have impacted the overall operations.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - Process'
The rise in process-related change management issues in Q2 and Q3 2022 reflects potential failures in executing planned changes, especially in business processes. The decline in 2023 may indicate corrective measures were put in place.

'Did not follow documented policies, procedures or tasks'
The frequency of these events in 2022 suggests either a lack of awareness or miscommunication about the policies and procedures. The reduction in 2023 may reflect improvements in training or enforcement of policies.

'Partner Fulfillment'
The consistent increase in partner fulfillment issues, particularly in 2022, points to challenges in managing external partnerships. The slight decrease in 2023 could imply that the company worked through these challenges by adjusting fulfillment strategies.

'Insufficient business monitoring / reporting'
The increase in reporting and monitoring issues in 2022 could indicate inadequacies in the systems or tools used for business analysis. The decline in 2023 may suggest the implementation of more effective monitoring processes.

'Third party system failure or error'
The rise in third-party system failures, particularly in 2022, signals issues with vendor systems that were outside of the company’s direct control. The decrease in 2023 suggests that the issues may have been addressed by switching providers or improving vendor systems.

'Inadequate design, coding or testing of application / system'
A steady increase in events related to design and coding issues, particularly in 2022, implies that the development or testing processes were insufficient. The reduction in 2023 suggests improvements in software development practices and testing protocols.

'Insufficient / Inappropriate staffing'
Staffing issues seemed to fluctuate, with a noticeable peak in Q1 2022, potentially due to staffing shortages or poor alignment between workload and staff capacity. By 2023, the situation seems to have stabilized, likely due to hiring or better workforce management.

'Business Intent Gap'
The noticeable rise in business intent gaps, especially in 2022, highlights misalignments between strategic goals and execution. By 2023, the situation appears to have improved, indicating a better alignment between business objectives and operations.

'Third Party Associate Error'
The increase in third-party associate errors, particularly in 2022, suggests that external partners or vendors were experiencing errors in their work. The reduction in 2023 may reflect corrective measures, such as better training or process improvement with third-party vendors.

'Unknown'
The low number of unknown events throughout the periods suggests that either the root causes of certain incidents were not immediately identifiable or that these events were anomalies. A closer look might be necessary to categorize or clarify these incidents.
