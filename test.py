Third-Party Involvement: Conduent, an external partner, was responsible for handling the requests but failed to determine the correct routing.
Human Error or Process Failure: The issue was not due to a system malfunction but rather an error by a third-party associate in processing the requests.
Direct Impact on SLA: Because of the incorrect routing and mismanagement by Conduent, Spec Ops was unable to meet the 7-day requirement for completion.
Incorrect Submission by Customers: While customers submitted requests through the wrong channel, it was the responsibility of the third-party associate (Conduent) to properly handle and route them.
