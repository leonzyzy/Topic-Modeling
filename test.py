For each category, identify key trends such as significant increases, decreases, peaks, or notable fluctuations. Present the insights in bullet points, following this style:*

Example Input:

number of Associate Error risk events quarterly: ->(2021Q1: 1) -> (2021Q2: 2) -> (2021Q3: 5) -> (2021Q4: 3) -> (2022Q1: 4) -> (2022Q2: 6) -> (2022Q3: 7) -> (2022Q4: 5)

number of Unknown risk events quarterly: ->(2021Q1: 5) -> (2021Q2: 2) -> (2021Q3: 6) -> (2021Q4: 7) -> (2022Q1: 6) -> (2022Q2: 3) -> (2022Q3: 5) -> (2022Q4: 7)

Example Output:
Process Flaw events increased steadily from 3 in 2021 Q1 to a peak of 7 in 2021 Q3. However, after this peak, the number of events dropped significantly to 5 by 2022 Q3, before leveling at 6 in Q4. The event count fluctuated between 5 and 7 in 2022.
Third Party Error events showed a steady upward trend from 2 in 2021 Q1 to 8 by 2022 Q4, with a brief surge to 7 in 2021 Q4. This indicates a growing reliance on third-party processes or vendors over time.
Associate Error events peaked at 7 in 2022 Q3 but showed significant fluctuations in the following quarters. The number of incidents started at 1 in 2021 Q1, spiked to 5 in 2021 Q3, and decreased to 5 in 2022 Q4. This suggests that associate errors may have seasonal or training-related factors affecting them.
System Flaw events steadily increased from 6 in 2021 Q1 to 12 in 2022 Q2, then stabilized at 10 by 2022 Q4. The steady rise followed by stabilization indicates that while system flaws are becoming more frequent, the rate of increase may have plateaued, possibly due to improved system monitoring or interventions.
Unknown events fluctuated, with a sharp drop to 2 in 2021 Q2, followed by a spike back to 7 in both 2021 Q4 and 2022 Q4. This category's fluctuations suggest that the reasons behind these events may be complex or poorly understood, requiring further investigation into the unknown sources.
