Backlog Due to High Volume – The influx in queue volume created a backlog for the team, which indicates that the team was unable to handle the increased workload effectively. This points to an issue with staffing levels or team capacity, as they were not equipped to manage the higher volume of work.

Team Unprepared for Higher Workload – The team was not ready to take on higher volumes of work, suggesting that the staffing or resourcing for this team was not sufficient or appropriately managed to meet the increased demand.

Inadequate Forecasting for Production Bandwidth – The process changes sent more cases to the catch-all queue without proper forecasting for production bandwidth, which could have been addressed by adjusting staffing levels or resources. The inability to handle the higher workload points to insufficient or inappropriate staffing planning.
