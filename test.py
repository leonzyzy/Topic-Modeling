The issue stems from inadequate or inaccurate procedures because agents relied on misleading report data, which led them to incorrectly assume an LSRP was needed before applying credits.

Additionally, there was no validation step to ensure agents handled these cases correctly, creating a procedural gap that resulted in errors.
