Assumption about ARN Uniqueness – The intent behind the process was to remove duplicate cases based on the ARN. However, there was a gap in the business understanding or communication regarding the uniqueness of the ARN. The assumption that the ARN was 100% unique was incorrect, leading to valid cases being removed. This gap between the business intent (removing duplicates) and the actual behavior of the system (not accounting for ARN's 98% uniqueness) created a failure in execution.

Unawareness of Data Issue – The business did not account for the fact that the ARN wasn't fully unique when designing the process, which points to a misunderstanding or lack of awareness in the business's intent regarding how the data would behave. The intention to clean the data by removing duplicates was not fully aligned with the actual data characteristics, highlighting a gap in business planning or oversight.
