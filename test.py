Incorrect File Sent – Fiserv sent a previous day's file with the incorrect date, which indicates a failure in monitoring and verifying the accuracy of the file before it was sent.
No Action Taken Workflow – Capital One requested the correct report, but it was marked as "no action taken," showing that there was no proactive monitoring or follow-up on the request.
Rotating Workflow Agents – Agents rotate weekly and were unaware that the report required action. This suggests a lack of clear communication or oversight between the rotating agents, leading to inconsistent handling of the report.
Lack of Communication – The absence of communication between workflow agents from week to week highlights a gap in oversight, leading to a missed opportunity for proper handling of the report.
Process Gap Identified – A process gap was identified in the check-free report process, further supporting that monitoring and oversight were insufficient to prevent the issue from occurring.
