System Limitation – The TSYS screen (MAHB) was only designed to update the high balance value, not the history, indicating a functional constraint in the system.
Lack of Manual Override – The application does not allow for a manual update of high balance history, preventing corrections when needed.
Process Deficiency – The process was not designed to address or compensate for the system's inability to update history, leading to incomplete data.
