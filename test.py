Lack of Clear Guidance – The documented procedures do not provide specific instructions on how to accurately update accounts in TSYS after fraud claims are deemed valid.
Agent Misinterpretation – Fraud agents mistakenly interpret the small business name as an authorized user, leading to incorrect updates.
System and Process Gap – There is no structured procedure ensuring that commercial tradelines are properly deleted from the commercial credit bureau.
Procedural Deficiency – The issue stems from missing or unclear procedural documentation rather than agents failing to follow existing instructions.
