Process-Driven Issue – The intent was to remove duplicates, but the method used was flawed because it assumed ARN (Acquirer Reference Number) was unique when it wasn't.
Incorrect Assumption in Workflow – The process relied on ARN as a unique identifier, leading to unintended exclusions or errors in reporting.
Not a Technical/System Failure – This is not a system crash or third-party failure, but rather a misalignment in how the process was designed and executed.
Process Design Gap – The oversight in the logic of duplicate removal indicates a gap in the end-to-end process flow rather than a simple one-time mistake.
