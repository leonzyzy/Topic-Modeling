Insights:
'Inadequate / inaccurate procedures' risk events peaked at 12 in Q1 2023 before showing a slight downward trend. This could indicate procedural issues that escalated in late 2022 but were somewhat mitigated in 2023, possibly through enhanced training or process standardization.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - System' risk events rose steadily until Q3 2022 (13 events) and then declined. This suggests that system change management challenges became more pronounced before stabilizing, likely due to improvements in transition planning or system upgrades.

'Capacity or Performance Deficiency' risk events increased sharply, peaking at 12 in Q2 2023, then declining slightly. This may indicate an operational strain that reached critical levels mid-2023, possibly due to increased system loads or staffing shortages, before corrective actions were taken.

'Third Party Associate Error' risk events reached their highest at 13 in Q4 2022 before steadily decreasing. This trend suggests that third-party-related issues were a growing concern in 2022 but were addressed successfully in 2023, potentially through better partner management or revised contractual agreements.

'Unknown' risk events saw a peak at 9 in Q2 2022 before steadily declining. The decrease may be due to improved classification methods, allowing for better root cause identification of incidents rather than attributing them to an unknown category.

Comments:
'Inadequate / inaccurate procedures' risk events peaked at 12 in Q1 2023 before showing a slight downward trend. -> Good! (Accurate observation with a reasonable explanation.)

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - System' risk events rose steadily until Q3 2022 (13 events) and then declined. -> Good! (The peak and decline are correctly identified.)

'Capacity or Performance Deficiency' risk events increased sharply, peaking at 12 in Q2 2023, then declining slightly. -> Wrong! (The decline was not significant enough to classify as a trend.)

'Third Party Associate Error' risk events reached their highest at 13 in Q4 2022 before steadily decreasing. -> Good! (Accurate trend identification with a plausible explanation.)

'Unknown' risk events saw a peak at 9 in Q2 2022 before steadily declining. -> Useless! (The insight lacks a strong actionable takeaway and doesn't provide enough context.)
