Incorrect logic implementation – The Vintage system did not accurately convert TSYS payment history due to misalignment in data handling.
Limited scope in code design – The code was originally designed only for Whirl accounts but was mistakenly applied to all account types, leading to errors.
Lack of testing – Since this was a new process for TSYS purged accounts, there was no available test data, which led to undetected issues before deployment.
Failure to adapt system changes properly – The tech team did not fully account for how the payment history rebuild would affect all account types, causing system misalignment.
