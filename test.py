Insights from the Analyst:

'Inadequate / inaccurate procedures' risk events peaked at 12 in Q4 2022, followed by a decline in 2023, suggesting remediation efforts and process improvement.

Comment: Correct! The peak and the decline in 2023 are consistent with a plausible explanation of process improvements.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - System' risk events peaked at 10 in Q1 2022, with a steady decline through 2023, which could reflect improvements in system change management.

Comment: Incorrect. While there was a peak of 10 in Q1 2022, the decline does not appear to be steady. It actually stabilizes in Q3 2023, which suggests a different explanation, possibly related to a recurring system issue not fully resolved by 2023.

'Capacity or Performance Deficiency' risk events peaked at 10 in Q4 2022, followed by a sharp drop in 2023, possibly indicating resolution of performance issues.

Comment: Correct! The sharp drop after Q4 2022 indicates a successful resolution of issues, which is reasonable.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - Process' risk events peaked at 9 in Q4 2022, and showed a decrease in 2023. This could be attributed to better process controls implemented.

Comment: Incorrect. The decrease is not as sharp as expected. The events stayed relatively steady from Q4 2022 to Q1 2023. This could suggest that while changes were made, they might not have fully addressed the root cause.

'Did not follow documented policies, procedures or tasks' risk events increased steadily in 2022, then declined in 2023, reflecting a natural improvement in adherence to policies.

Comment: Correct! The gradual increase followed by a decline aligns with a typical pattern where issues were identified and addressed.

'Partner Fulfillment' risk events saw an increase in 2022 and leveled off in 2023, indicating better partner performance or improved monitoring.

Comment: Incorrect. There is a significant drop in Q4 2022, which suggests a change in the partner dynamics, possibly a decrease in partner performance or a change in partner strategy.

'Insufficient business monitoring / reporting' risk events increased throughout 2022, with a slight decline in 2023, indicating more targeted monitoring activities.

Comment: Correct! The increase in 2022 followed by a slight decline in 2023 suggests a responsive action to improve monitoring and reporting.

'Third party system failure or error' risk events peaked in 2022 and declined in 2023, possibly due to system upgrades or changes with third-party vendors.

Comment: Incorrect. The decline actually began in Q3 2022, suggesting a resolution of third-party errors much earlier than anticipated, possibly due to a contract renegotiation or vendor replacement.

Number of 'Inadequate design, coding or testing of application / system' risk events quarterly: -> (2021Q1: 3) -> (2021Q2: 4) -> (2021Q3: 5) -> (2021Q4: 6) -> (2022Q1: 8) -> (2022Q2: 9) -> (2022Q3: 11) -> (2022Q4: 10) -> (2023Q1: 9) -> (2023Q2: 7) -> (2023Q3: 5) -> (2023Q4: 4)

Number of 'Insufficient / Inappropriate staffing' risk events quarterly: -> (2021Q1: 2) -> (2021Q2: 3) -> (2021Q3: 4) -> (2021Q4: 5) -> (2022Q1: 6) -> (2022Q2: 8) -> (2022Q3: 9) -> (2022Q4: 8) -> (2023Q1: 7) -> (2023Q2: 6) -> (2023Q3: 5) -> (2023Q4: 4)

Number of 'Business Intent Gap' risk events quarterly: -> (2021Q1: 1) -> (2021Q2: 2) -> (2021Q3: 3) -> (2021Q4: 4) -> (2022Q1: 5) -> (2022Q2: 6) -> (2022Q3: 7) -> (2022Q4: 6) -> (2023Q1: 5) -> (2023Q2: 4) -> (2023Q3: 3) -> (2023Q4: 2)

Number of 'Third Party Associate Error' risk events quarterly: -> (2021Q1: 5) -> (2021Q2: 7) -> (2021Q3: 8) -> (2021Q4: 9) -> (2022Q1: 11) -> (2022Q2: 12) -> (2022Q3: 14) -> (2022Q4: 13) -> (2023Q1: 10) -> (2023Q2: 8) -> (2023Q3: 7) -> (2023Q4: 6)

Number of 'Unknown' risk events quarterly: -> (2021Q1: 1) -> (2021Q2: 2) -> (2021Q3: 3) -> (2021Q4: 4) -> (2022Q1: 6) -> (2022Q2: 5) -> (2022Q3: 7) -> (2022Q4: 6) -> (2023Q1: 5) -> (2023Q2: 3) -> (2023Q3: 2) -> (2023Q4: 2)

Insights from the Analyst:

'Inadequate design, coding or testing of application / system' risk events showed a gradual increase until Q3 2022, followed by a slight decline in 2023, suggesting resolution of some system issues or effective redesign efforts.

Comment: Correct! The gradual increase followed by a decline aligns with a resolution process after key issues were identified and addressed.

'Insufficient / Inappropriate staffing' risk events consistently increased through 2022, with a slight decline in 2023, indicating staffing adjustments or resource optimization.

Comment: Incorrect. While there was an increase through 2022, the decline in 2023 is relatively small. It could suggest that staffing improvements were slow or not fully effective, and staffing challenges persisted.

'Business Intent Gap' risk events peaked in Q4 2022, and then declined significantly in 2023, possibly reflecting alignment of business goals or more focused planning.

Comment: Incorrect. The decline in 2023 is not significant enough to confirm a direct improvement. The data suggests a slower alignment of business goals with a persistent gap.

'Third Party Associate Error' risk events saw a steady increase in 2022, with a slight decrease in 2023, possibly reflecting better vendor management or resolution of third-party errors.

Comment: Incorrect. The risk events showed a major increase through Q3 2022, and the decrease afterward seems to be due to a vendor change or reduction in errors. It's not just better vendor management.

'Unknown' risk events increased through 2022, then slightly declined in 2023, possibly due to better detection and reporting of risks, or changes in the risk categorization process.

Comment: Correct! The increase followed by a decline is typical of a process of addressing and categorizing unknown risks.
