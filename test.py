@@Chain of Thought:  
1. Lost, stolen, and failed transactions were accounted for in reporting fraud claims.  
2. When transactions were captured in the failure report, agents were unable to determine how to care for customer needs.  
3. Agents did not have the necessary information to assess the required next steps for transactions populating on the report.  
4. The procedures for managing the monitoring reports were incomplete, as the team did not have detailed instructions to handle this process before it was added to their work.
