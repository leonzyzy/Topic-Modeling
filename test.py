Changes to Scripting Led to Issues – The root cause of the issue lies in the changes made to the scripting, which resulted in the failure to capture the updated LSRP acknowledgment letter scenarios. The system was not adjusted or tested properly to account for these changes, which led to the omission of cases requiring a letter to be sent.

Lack of Proper System Updates – When the system was modified, there was a failure to ensure that the Empath Exceptions (EE) report accurately captured all the cases that required follow-up actions, such as sending the acknowledgment letter. This points to a lack of proper change management practices, where the new system logic wasn't comprehensively reviewed or tested to ensure it functioned as intended across all scenarios.

Failure to Address Impact of Changes – The changes to the scripting were not communicated or accounted for in the context of the broader system's behavior. This failure indicates that change management processes (like testing, validation, and monitoring after implementation) were not sufficient or effective in identifying and addressing the gap caused by the script changes.
