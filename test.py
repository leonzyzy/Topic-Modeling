refers to a disconnect or misalignment between the intended business goals or objectives and the execution of processes, systems, or workflows. This gap occurs when the business rules, requirements, or priorities are not clearly defined, understood, or communicated, leading to unintended outcomes or failure to meet desired objectives.
