Insights:
'Inadequate / inaccurate procedures' risk events peaked at 14 in Q3 2022 before declining to 8 in Q4 2023. This suggests a major procedural issue in 2022 that was mitigated over time, possibly due to revised policies or staff training.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - System' risk events surged to 15 in Q2 2022 but have been steadily declining since. This indicates that system transition challenges were most severe in mid-2022 but may have improved due to enhanced oversight or better project management.

'Capacity or Performance Deficiency' risk events showed a steady rise, peaking at 14 in Q4 2022, before dropping significantly. The drop in 2023 suggests that capacity constraints were alleviated, potentially through infrastructure improvements or process optimizations.

'Third Party Associate Error' risk events increased to 13 in Q2 2023 but remained elevated afterward. This could indicate recurring issues with third-party associates, requiring better vendor management, compliance checks, or revised service agreements.

'Unknown' risk events showed a peak at 10 in Q4 2022 but have steadily decreased. This suggests that improved classification and root cause analysis may have reduced reliance on the "Unknown" category.
