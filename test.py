Intent Gap: The company intended to fulfill statements for accounts that completed the settlement agreement, but due to an issue in the execution scripts, these accounts were not properly identified.
Business Process Issue: Unlike a third-party fulfillment failure, this problem originates from an internal process or logic gap in the execution scripts.
Preventable Error: The issue was not due to an external factor (like USPS delays) but a gap in business rules or automation that failed to capture the correct accounts for fulfillment.
