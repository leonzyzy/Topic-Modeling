The issue is a System Flaw caused by changes in scripting that prevented the updated LSRP acknowledgment letter scenarios from being captured in the Empath Exceptions (EE) report. As a result, the agent did not send the necessary acknowledgment letters to the population missed by Empath. This failure originated from a system-level error in data processing, leading to incomplete communication and operational inefficiencies.
