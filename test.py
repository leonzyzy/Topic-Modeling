Lack of Backup for Critical Task – The agent responsible for pulling the control report went out of the office with no established backup. This highlights an issue with staffing and coverage for essential tasks. Without proper backup, the process could not continue smoothly, leading to the failure in handling secured documents.

No Business Continuity Plan – The absence of a business continuity plan indicates a staffing issue. The plan would have ensured that there was a clear procedure and resources in place to maintain operations in the absence of key staff members. The failure to establish this plan exacerbated the issue by leaving the task uncovered.

Inability to Maintain Process Due to Staffing Gaps – Because there was no backup for the agent, the report for secured document uploads was not pulled, leading to work not being done. This illustrates how insufficient staffing and lack of preparedness in staffing affected the execution of the process.
