Insights:
'Inadequate / inaccurate procedures' risk events showed a steady increase until Q1 2023, peaking at 12 before decreasing slightly by Q4 2023. This suggests that the organization was facing recurring procedural issues but made improvements or saw fewer incidents toward the end of 2023.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - System' risk events peaked in Q4 2021 with 7 events but have been steadily decreasing since, dropping to 2 events by Q4 2023. This indicates that change management practices were improved and stabilized over time.

'Capacity or Performance Deficiency' risk events peaked in Q2 2022 with 10 events and remained relatively high in 2023. This suggests that the system experienced performance issues, but the trend stabilized in the second half of 2023, potentially due to enhancements made in system capacity.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - Process' risk events showed fluctuations through 2021 and 2022, peaking at 6 in Q2 2022 before dropping again. However, they have remained relatively stable in 2023, showing that process issues were somewhat resolved or became predictable.
