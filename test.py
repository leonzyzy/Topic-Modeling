This issue falls under Inadequate / Failed Change Management - System because:

Failure to update the script – When Visa migrated to Empath, the "Missing Debits" report script was not updated to reflect the change, leading to Visa accounts being excluded.
Lack of ownership – There was no clearly defined intent owner responsible for maintaining and updating the report, which caused the oversight to go unaddressed.
Communication breakdown – The TiVo team, responsible for maintaining the script, was not properly informed of the need to remove Visa exclusions.
