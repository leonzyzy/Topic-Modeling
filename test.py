@@@ Give your comments:

'Inadequate / inaccurate procedures' risk events peaked at 12 in Q4 2022, followed by a decline in 2023, suggesting remediation efforts and process improvement. -> Good! (The peak and trend are accurately identified with a plausible explanation of remediation efforts.)

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - System' risk events peaked at 10 in Q1 2022, with a steady decline through 2023, which could reflect improvements in system change management. -> Good! (The trend is correct, and the suggestion of system improvements is reasonable.)

'Capacity or Performance Deficiency' risk events peaked at 10 in Q4 2022, followed by a sharp drop in 2023, possibly indicating resolution of performance issues. -> Good! (The peak and sharp drop are well-described, and the reasoning is logical.)

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - Process' risk events peaked at 9 in Q4 2022, declining in 2023, which may signal process optimization or better process oversight. -> Good! (The peak and subsequent decline are identified, and the reasoning fits the data.)

'Did not follow documented policies, procedures or tasks' risk events peaked at 14 in Q4 2022, with a steady decline through 2023, possibly due to improved compliance training and enforcement. -> Good! (The peak and trend match, and the explanation of improved training and enforcement is a valid hypothesis.)
