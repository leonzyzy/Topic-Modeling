Lack of Awareness: The business was unaware of the reporting requirements, meaning there was a gap between what should have been done and what was actually executed.
Missing Procedures: Since no procedures were documented or shared, the intended process was not properly established, leading to a failure in execution.
Knowledge Transfer Failure: Staffing changes caused a loss of critical information, preventing the business from taking the necessary actions.
Not a Third-Party Issue: Unlike Partner Fulfillment, this is an internal process breakdown, not caused by an external vendor or service provider.
