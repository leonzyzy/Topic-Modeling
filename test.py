@@@ Here are the insights from your analyst:

'Inadequate / inaccurate procedures' risk events:
The number of 'Inadequate / inaccurate procedures' risk events increased significantly from 2021Q1 to 2022Q1, with a noticeable decline in Q2 2022, followed by another rise towards the end of 2022. This suggests that while initial processes were identified as problematic, corrective actions might have temporarily decreased the number of incidents, but issues resurfaced later on.
Good! This analysis captures the broader trend, including the brief decline in Q2 2022 and the subsequent rise. Identifying corrective actions is a good point.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - System' risk events:
The number of events increased steadily from 2021Q1 to 2022Q4, peaking in 2022Q3. This suggests that there were critical issues with system changes, possibly tied to major updates or infrastructure changes in mid-2022, leading to higher failure rates.
Wrong! The events peaked in 2021Q4, not in 2022Q3. Misinterpreting the peak misguides potential analysis around system update periods.

'Capacity or Performance Deficiency' risk events:
These events grew steadily from 2021Q1 to 2022Q4, peaking slightly in 2023Q1. This could indicate that the company's capacity or performance was under increasing strain, with peak business periods or challenges in scaling operations.
Useless! The trend actually dropped significantly in Q3 2023 and does not have a sharp peak. The insight doesn’t provide actionable value and doesn’t match the data trend.

'Inadequate / Failed Change Management - Process' risk events:
The number of process-related failures showed a consistent increase from 2021Q1 to 2022Q4, with a slight dip in 2023Q1. This suggests that, despite some improvements in early 2023, issues with change management processes persisted, indicating a structural problem with how processes were managed.
Good! The analysis correctly identifies the increasing trend in 2021-2022 and the slight dip in early 2023. It gives a relevant explanation tied to process management.

'Did not follow documented policies, procedures or tasks' risk events:
These events showed a steady increase over the quarters, with a peak in 2022Q4. This likely signals an organizational shift towards non-compliance or failure to follow documented guidelines, possibly due to higher workload or policy fatigue among employees.
Wrong! The peak actually occurred in 2022Q3, not Q4. This is crucial for pinpointing when corrective actions might have been needed.

'Partner Fulfillment' risk events:
Risk events related to partner fulfillment increased sharply in 2022, with a gradual decline in 2023. This may reflect improving partner relationships or more effective processes to address fulfillment issues by mid-2023.
Good! Correctly identifies the rise and decline over time, and the analysis about improving processes by mid-2023 aligns with the decreasing trend.

'Insufficient business monitoring / reporting' risk events:
The trend here showed a sharp rise from 2021Q1 to 2022Q4, followed by a moderate decrease in 2023Q1. The high number in 2022 suggests that insufficient monitoring or reporting was a significant risk during that year.
Good! Identifies the sharp rise, correctly attributing it to operational shortcomings in monitoring. The moderate decrease in 2023 is noted as well.

'Third party system failure or error' risk events:
These events experienced a gradual increase from 2021Q1 to 2022Q1, followed by a sharp decline in 2023Q3, indicating that external factors like third-party system failures had significant impacts at the beginning of the period but were somewhat resolved by 2023.
Useless! The decline is gradual across 2023, not sharp. Focusing on a sudden decline adds confusion to the analysis.

'Inadequate design, coding or testing of application / system' risk events:
This category saw a steady rise over the entire period, with a slight peak in 2022Q4. This likely points to ongoing issues in system development and testing, suggesting that despite improvements, the organization faced ongoing challenges in ensuring systems were adequately designed and tested.
Good! Identifies the rise and the slight peak, which is accurate. The reasoning about the ongoing challenges in system design and testing is valid.

'Insufficient / Inappropriate staffing' risk events:
Staffing-related risks showed a consistent increase in early 2022, peaking in Q3 2022, followed by a decline in 2023Q1. The decrease could indicate that staffing issues were addressed or resolved as the business adjusted to operational needs.
Wrong! The peak actually occurred in 2022Q4, not Q3 2022. Misplacing the peak could suggest actions that were not actually effective at the right time.

'Business Intent Gap' risk events:
These events followed a steady increase from 2021Q1 to 2022Q3, peaking in 2022Q4 and gradually declining in 2023. This might reflect a growing awareness of misalignments in business goals and strategy, with the peak suggesting a critical awareness period for the organization.
Good! Correctly identifies the trend and peak in Q4 2022, attributing it to misalignments in business strategy, which is a good insight.

'Third Party Associate Error' risk events:
There was a steady increase in third-party associate errors from 2021Q1 to 2022Q2, with a decline in 2023. This could indicate a decreasing dependency on third-party associates or better oversight to minimize errors in 2023.
Useless! The insight doesn't align with the data, which shows an increase throughout 2022 with a drop in Q4 2023. The vague conclusion doesn’t contribute to identifying exact causes.

'Unknown' risk events:
'Unknown' events followed a steady rise from 2021Q1 to 2022Q1, then plateaued. This may indicate a consistent level of unidentified or unclassified risks throughout the period.
Wrong! The rise was not steady; there were noticeable fluctuations in the trend. The plateau only occurred much later in the data, not at the beginning of 2022.
