Number of 'Process Flaw' risk events quarterly:
-> (2021Q1: 3) -> (2021Q2: 4) -> (2021Q3: 5) -> (2021Q4: 4) -> (2022Q1: 6) -> (2022Q2: 7) -> (2022Q3: 6) -> (2022Q4: 5) -> (2023Q1: 4) -> (2023Q2: 3) -> (2023Q3: 2) -> (2023Q4: 3) -> (2024Q1: 3) -> (2024Q2: 2) -> (2024Q3: 3) -> (2024Q4: 2) -> (2025Q1: 2)

Insights:

Initial Increase and Peak: 'Process Flaw' events peaked in 2022Q2, with 7 events, signaling a period of higher operational issues. This could be due to increased complexity in process changes or the introduction of new operational structures.

Declining Trend: After the peak in 2022Q2, the number of events decreased, reaching a stable count of 2 events per quarter by 2025Q1. This suggests that corrective actions were effective or processes became more optimized over time.

Stabilization: The reduction in 'Process Flaw' events in 2023 and 2024 reflects process improvements or lessons learned from the earlier periods.

'Third Party Error' events:
Number of 'Third Party Error' risk events quarterly:
-> (2021Q1: 1) -> (2021Q2: 2) -> (2021Q3: 3) -> (2021Q4: 2) -> (2022Q1: 4) -> (2022Q2: 5) -> (2022Q3: 4) -> (2022Q4: 3) -> (2023Q1: 2) -> (2023Q2: 1) -> (2023Q3: 2) -> (2023Q4: 1) -> (2024Q1: 2) -> (2024Q2: 1) -> (2024Q3: 1) -> (2024Q4: 2) -> (2025Q1: 2)

Insights:

Initial Spike: 'Third Party Error' events saw an increase in 2022, especially in Q2 (5 events), likely due to issues with third-party providers or vendors, which could have caused interruptions or service failures.

Fluctuating Trend: After the peak, the events fluctuate between 1 and 4 events each quarter. The slight reductions in the later periods could indicate improved monitoring of third-party systems or better vendor management.

External Dependency: As 'Third Party Error' events are influenced by external partners, the varying counts suggest that issues arose with specific vendors or service providers at different times.

'Associate Error' events:
Number of 'Associate Error' risk events quarterly:
-> (2021Q1: 2) -> (2021Q2: 3) -> (2021Q3: 3) -> (2021Q4: 4) -> (2022Q1: 3) -> (2022Q2: 2) -> (2022Q3: 3) -> (2022Q4: 4) -> (2023Q1: 3) -> (2023Q2: 3) -> (2023Q3: 2) -> (2023Q4: 3) -> (2024Q1: 2) -> (2024Q2: 2) -> (2024Q3: 3) -> (2024Q4: 2) -> (2025Q1: 3)

Insights:

Consistent Frequency: 'Associate Error' events show a consistent frequency across the periods, with fluctuations around 2 to 4 events per quarter. This suggests that associate-related issues are recurring but stabilized.

Minor Reductions: A slight reduction in the number of events in 2022 and 2023 suggests improvements in associate training or better error tracking systems.

Operational Impact: These errors could be linked to human mistakes, which are less likely to be entirely eliminated but may benefit from better process controls or associate support.

'System Flaw' events:
Number of 'System Flaw' risk events quarterly:
-> (2021Q1: 2) -> (2021Q2: 3) -> (2021Q3: 4) -> (2021Q4: 3) -> (2022Q1: 4) -> (2022Q2: 5) -> (2022Q3: 3) -> (2022Q4: 4) -> (2023Q1: 2) -> (2023Q2: 3) -> (2023Q3: 2) -> (2023Q4: 4) -> (2024Q1: 3) -> (2024Q2: 2) -> (2024Q3: 3) -> (2024Q4: 2)

Insights:

Fluctuating System Issues: 'System Flaw' events fluctuated over time, with spikes observed in 2022Q2 (5 events) and 2023Q4 (4 events). These fluctuations likely correlate with system updates, deployments, or high-volume usage periods when system vulnerabilities are more likely to surface.

Decreasing Trend: The number of 'System Flaw' events appears to stabilize at 2 or 3 events per quarter starting from 2023, indicating better system performance or more effective fixes to vulnerabilities.

System Improvements: The later stabilization suggests that the issues causing 'System Flaw' events may have been addressed with regular system monitoring and updates.

'Unknown' events:
Number of 'Unknown' risk events quarterly:
-> (2021Q1: 1) -> (2021Q2: 2) -> (2021Q3: 1) -> (2021Q4: 2) -> (2022Q1: 1) -> (2022Q2: 2) -> (2022Q3: 1) -> (2022Q4: 1) -> (2023Q1: 1) -> (2023Q2: 2) -> (2023Q3: 1) -> (2023Q4: 1) -> (2024Q1: 1) -> (2024Q2: 1) -> (2024Q3: 2) -> (2024Q4: 1) -> (2025Q1: 1)

Insights:

Stable but Low Frequency: 'Unknown' events remain low and stable across the entire period. These events might not be fully identified or categorized, suggesting either unreported issues or challenges in the classification of risk events.

Impact of Uncertainty: The consistent low number of 'Unknown' events implies that efforts could be made to improve event classification or reporting accuracy. However, this remains a relatively minor concern compared to other event types.

Improvement in Classification: The data could indicate improved tracking and categorization over time, as the number of 'Unknown' events did not rise significantly despite fluctuations in other categories.
