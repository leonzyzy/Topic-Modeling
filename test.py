Static Table Not Refreshed – The original table used to pull the population for the Trailing Transactions report was static and not refreshed, which means the system design didn't account for the need to update data regularly. This indicates a flaw in the design or coding of the system, as it failed to function as intended over time.

Report Failing to Populate Correct Data – The Trailing Transactions report was not populating the necessary information to be shared with operations to work, pointing to a coding issue in how the data was retrieved and presented.

New Table Created but Duplicative Cases – When a new table was created to replace the static one, it populated duplicative and outdated cases. This indicates an issue in how the new table was designed or coded to handle data, further emphasizing a failure in the system's development and implementation.

Failure to Address Process Needs – The system was not designed to ensure that transactions were pulled properly and consistently, resulting in a backlog and missed transactions. This lack of foresight and attention to the ongoing refresh and accuracy of data is a design and coding issue.
