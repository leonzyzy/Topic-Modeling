Backlog Due to Increased Volume – The influx of cases led to a backlog, suggesting that the team did not have enough staff or capacity to handle the workload efficiently.
Team Was Not Prepared for Higher Work Volume – This indicates that staffing levels were not adequately planned to meet the demand.
More Cases Sent to the Catch-All Queue – A growing queue suggests that there were either too few people assigned to process the cases or an inefficient allocation of resources.
Process Changes Without Proper Forecasting – This implies that workforce planning did not account for production bandwidth, leading to a staffing mismatch.
